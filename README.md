# Universal Wifi pineapple hardware cloner: Builds

For a long time I have noticed that there are people stealing the authorship of this project that started in 2018.
Also there is people who go further and are selling the devices ready to use...

So to prevent anyone from being scammed paying for something that is public and free, I decided to make a second repo with the builds already generated.
Maybe some routers need a little more work as is the case of the GL-AR150 where [this script](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-cloner/blob/master/fixs/nano/02-network-ar150-fix) does the magic.
The idea is to invite the community to collaborate with these extra scripts, they can be sent as pull requests from the [original project](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-cloner).


## Hardware info

As the tetra is intended to be used on hardware with 32MB of flash it is recommended to use it with a pendrive.
The steps for this would be:
1. The pendrive has to be formatted from the pineapple panel
2. Connect the pinneaple to the internet and restart it
3. When pineapple starts it will run the [20-sd-tetra-fix script](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-cloner/blob/master/fixs/tetra/20-sd-tetra-fix) and install the missing packages on the pendrive


It could also be done by hand by running this command:
```
opkg update && opkg --dest sd install python-logging python-openssl python-sqlite3 python-codecs && python -m compileall
```

However this is completely optional because pineapple will work fine without those packages.
Although we would need the pendrive to be able to install the modules...!
